# Go Back in Time

Go back in time and see how a specific page used to look using a variety of page caching/archiving services

For some resaon this addon got removed from Chrome's web store, despite not violating any policies as far as I can see
in the code. To save it, I unpacked it, then decided to migrate it to Manifest v3 so I won't lose the extension in the
future.

Installation works like typical unpacked extensions: 
* Download the zip file and unzip to a new folder. 
* Open Extensions, turn on developer options, load unpacked
* Choose the appropriate version folder
